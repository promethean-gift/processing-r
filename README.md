Our analyses were run using Docker containers on NSF CyVerse and University of Arizona cyberinfrastructure.

After you create a [CyVerse Account](https://user.cyverse.org/) (free), you can launch the container used in our analyses here: <a href="https://de.cyverse.org/de/?type=quick-launch&quick-launch-id=12f25023-b6b1-4f23-bbcc-49f0295da8c4&app-id=07e2b2e6-becd-11e9-b524-008cfa5ae621" target="_blank"><img src="https://de.cyverse.org/Powered-By-CyVerse-blue.svg"></a> 

Alternately, you can install [Docker](https://docker.com) and run the analysis on your local computer:

```
docker run -it --rm -v /$HOME:/workspace --workdir /workspace -p 8787:80 -e REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8787 cyversevice/rstudio-geospatial:4.0.0
```

# steps
